# Agile
![agile](static/media/readME/userstory.png)

For this project the GitHub Kanban agile project management tool was used to create EPICs, add User Stories to these EPICs and give each user story relevant tasks.
I did not utilize this tool to its full potential throughout this project. As I was left with very limited time to actually work on my PP4, I found myself rushing.
However when I did use this Agili tool I did find it very helpful in keeping me on the tasks at hand and keeping organized.
